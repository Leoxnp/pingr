Pingr pings all of your [repl](https://replit.com) projects at once without you having to have the tab open.

## Guide
1. Fork my repl [here](https://replit.com/@5XI/pingr?v=1).
2. Configure the `config.json` file with all the links you want to ping as well as the interval between pings.
3. Click the run button at the top of your screen.

It's as easy as that! If you have any issues, please report it under the [Issues](https://github.com/ffrrancis/pingr/issues) tab.
